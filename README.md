# CelsiusFahrenheitConverter-CSharp

Certainly! Here's a description for the project:

"Celsius Fahrenheit Converter" is a simple console application that allows users to convert temperatures between 
Celsius and Fahrenheit. Users can choose to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa by selecting the appropriate option.
The program prompts the user to enter a temperature value, performs the conversion, and displays the converted temperature.
This project serves as a basic demonstration of temperature conversion using C# and provides
a convenient tool for quick temperature conversions.
